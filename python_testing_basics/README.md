# Python automation testing basics
##UI testing with Python and Selenium Webdriver
Understanding the basics with data driven UI testing with Python, [Selenium](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium) &amp; [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) / [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html).

Note: '[nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)' is used only for standalone execution. As I use PyCharm with '[pydev](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/remote-debugging.html)' support for debugging and '[unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)' module for running the tests, I am actually not using it.

For DDT (Data driven testing) you have to install '[ddt](https://ddt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)', '[xlrd](http://www.python-excel.org/)' or use *csv*

## Automated tests framework - unittest
A test case is created by subclassing `unittest.TestCase`. The individual tests are defined with methods whose names start with the letters `test`. This naming convention informs the test runner about which methods represent tests. (see *ui_test_basics.py*)
The `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods allow you to define instructions that will be executed before and after each test method (used in *ui_test_basics5.py*).

## Other Automated tests
Files *ui_test_basics2.py*, *ui_test_basics3.py* and *ui_test_basics4.py* are basic .py scripts demonstrating the ability to build the automated test framework with Selenium Webdriver and Python. All except *ui_test_basics4.py* (Safari) and *ui_test_basics5* (Chrome) are using Firefox browser.
As Selenium Webdriver is native written for use with Firefox, so for other browser support there is need to install additional drivers (as described below).

##Using Safari browser
When you simply try to run a test using `webdriver.Safari()` you will get an `SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR` message.
I found several solutions for running Selenium Webdriver with Python bindings on Safari browser but none of them worked for me.
It should be easy. First, you need valid certificate from Apple. And yes, that's a major stop for me. Apple merged his Safari Developer Program with other one(s) and created Apple Developer Program which costs 99 USD per membership year. So a showstopper for me. If you have it, continue.
Second, you need to download '[Selenium Standalone Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)' and put it somewhere (I put it in the same directory as my python script). Then you are able to set the `SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR` variable:
`os.environ["SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR"] = "selenium-server-standalone-2.46.0.jar"`  
Don't forget to `import os`.  
Third, you need to install an extension into Safari. You can use downloaded .JAR file, copy it to a directory of your choice, run `jar xf selenium-server-standalone-2.46.0.jar` (the filename can be different in your case) and navigate to `org/openqa/selenium/safari` where *SafariDriver.safariextz* is located. Just install & activate it (Open Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions (tab)).

Note: if you have a solution for Safari 8 on Yosemite (10.10.X) which is working, pls share it with me.  
Note #2: there is a brew formula `selenium-server-standalone` which can be installed instead of downloading .JAR file.

##Using Chrome
Before you run a python file *ui_test_basics5.py* it is good to read 'Chromedriver - Getting Started (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started)' to find out how to configure the script to get chromedriver executable to work (best choice for MAC OS X is to download it to /usr/bin) and setup the PATH so you don't get any kind of error).

##Page object pattern script
In *PO_template_script* directory you can find a template script using page object pattern.

    test_case_script.py
     +-- page.py
      +-- element.py
      +-- locators.py

This approach is well-known as Page Objects Model (POM) as well. For further information and explanation how and why, please read carefully: [Page Objects in Python](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-08/page-objects-in-python)

### *Screenshot* functionality
In *ui_test_basics5.py* you will find the usage of "take screenshot on error" in the `test_2_search_by_name` test case. Another solution used in `tearDown()` method:

    import sys, unittest
    from datetime import datetime

    class TestCase(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            some_code

        def test_case(self):
            test case comes here

        def tearDown(self):
            if sys.exc_info()[0]:  # Returns the info of exception being handled
                fail_url = self.driver.current_url
                print fail_url
                now = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S-%f')
                self.driver.get_screenshot_as_file('/path/to/file/%s.png' % now) # my tests work in parallel, so I need uniqe file names
                fail_screenshot_url = 'http://debugtool/screenshots/%s.png' % now
                print fail_screenshot_url
            self.driver.quit()

### HTML report
HTMLTestRunner is an extension to the Python standard library's unittest module. It generates easy to use HTML test reports.
See *test_HTMLTestRunner.py* for test and demo of *HTMLTestRunner.py*

### Data driven testing
Example of *xlrd* impementation - *DDT/xlrd_example.py*


Coming soon (maybe):
- cross-browser script
- data driven script with csv source file
